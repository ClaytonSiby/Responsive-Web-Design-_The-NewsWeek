## Project Design:

![screenshot](./app_screenshot.png)

This project I designed it using bootstrap 4 classes for component layouts. I also implemented the bootstrap 4 grid system to responsively position content on the page on all screen sizes. Sass CSS acted as an alternative way to add more style on the elements & beauty on the site.

## Built With

- CSS, HTML, JavaScript
- Sass CSS, Bootstrap 4
- Stylelint validators
