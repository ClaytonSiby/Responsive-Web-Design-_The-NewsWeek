# Responsive-Web-Design-_The-NewsWeek
This project is a replica of the [NewsWeek](https://www.newsweek.com/) website. It is a part of the microverse curriculum mainly focusing on mobile first responsive design.

## Project Design:

* large/desktop screen view

This project was designed using bootstrap 4 classes for component layouts. I also implemented the bootstrap 4 grid system to responsively position content on the page on all screen sizes. Sass CSS acted as an alternative way to add more style on the elements & beauty on the site.

Please take note, this project has no functionality to it. It was designed as a means of strengthening mobile first design skills. And also, it is a microverse.inc mandatory project.
